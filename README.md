# Why Music

Author: Harrison Chen

Design: Why should you look for strange music? Maybe staying and waiting for help is a better choice?

Text Drawing: It render text on-the-fly, handles ligatures with Harfbuzz and render bitmap with
Freetype. It uses a cache to boost performance in case of massive text rendering. It is capable of
rendering antialiasing text with different color and different size in runtime. Multiple font families can be
handled by different instances.
